    "# Student Data Creation and Initial Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This notebook outlines the process for generating a large-scale synthetic dataset simulating student attributes relevant to predicting dropout in Indian government schools. The aim is to create a foundational dataset for subsequent exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process Overview:**\n",
    "1.  Define the schema and characteristics for student data, drawing inspiration from common educational datasets (e.g., UDISE+) and domain knowledge.\n",
    "2.  Programmatically generate synthetic records (e.g., 3 million students).\n",
    "3.  Introduce controlled variations and relationships between features to mimic real-world scenarios.\n",
    "4.  Perform very basic data cleaning (e.g., type conversions, renaming columns for consistency).\n",
    "5.  Save the generated raw dataset (`synthetic_student_data_combined.csv`) for more detailed exploration and preprocessing."
